//! Loud, digest-safe diagnostics for silently dropped faces.
//!
//! When a face fails to tessellate it is emitted with `surface = None` (or an
//! empty mesh). Historically this was *silent*: the meshed shell was quietly
//! missing a face and its volume was understated, with no signal at all (spec
//! 006 corner-100 revolve-pole cap -> mesh `None` -> volume read flat; spec 007
//! C3 periodic tube seam). This module is the tessellator-side analogue of the
//! kernel's typed-refusal doctrine: it makes every drop *visible* without
//! changing any geometry.
//!
//! Three layered, always-safe channels:
//!
//! * a process-global counter ([`face_drop_count`]) -- a queryable metric any
//!   caller can poll to learn that the emitted mesh is incomplete,
//! * a structured [`log::warn!`] naming the dropped face, its surface class and
//!   the reason (visible to any logger-equipped consumer -- viewer, GPU,
//!   renderer), and
//! * an `MT_FACE_DROP`- / `MT_MESH_TRACE`-gated `eprintln!` census line for
//!   offline blast-radius measurement.
//!
//! This module emits *observability only*. The mesh, the volume, and every
//! downstream boolean result are byte-identical whether or not a drop is
//! reported: the polygon is classified through a shared borrow and returned
//! unchanged. Escalating a drop to a hard/typed error is deliberately **out of
//! scope** here (it changes outcomes and needs a user decision -- see D1b).
